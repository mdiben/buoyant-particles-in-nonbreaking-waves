# buoyant-particles-in-nonbreaking-waves

This repository includes the Lagrangian tracking code used to generate the data in the manuscript: 
DiBenedetto, M.H., Non-breaking wave effects on buoyant particle distributions. Frontiers of Marine Science, 2020.
doi: 10.3389/fmars.2020.00148 

The function that creates the particle trajectories is "waves_turb_settling.m"
An example of how to run and interpret this data is in "example.m"

See the manuscript for more details.
